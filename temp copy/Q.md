To design an optimized RTL for calculating the given matrix using inputs \(\sin(\theta_1)\), \(\sin(\theta_2)\), \(\sin(\theta_3)\), \(\cos(\theta_1)\), \(\cos(\theta_2)\), \(\cos(\theta_3)\) and a valid bit, let's break down the approach. We will use a finite state machine (FSM) to manage the control logic, while leveraging parallelism and pipelining to optimize the computation. Here's how we can approach this:

### Matrix Structure Recap
The matrix is:

\[
\begin{bmatrix}
a_{11} & a_{12} & a_{13} \\
a_{21} & a_{22} & a_{23} \\
a_{31} & a_{32} & a_{33}
\end{bmatrix}
\]

Where:
- `\( a_{11} = \cos(\theta_1) \cos(\theta_2) \)`
- `\( a_{12} = -\sin(\theta_1)\cos(\theta_3) + \cos(\theta_1)\sin(\theta_2)\sin(\theta_3) \)`
- `\( a_{13} = \sin(\theta_1)\sin(\theta_3) + \cos(\theta_1)\sin(\theta_2)\cos(\theta_3) \)`
- `\( a_{21} = \sin(\theta_1) \cos(\theta_2) \)`
- `\( a_{22} = \cos(\theta_1)\cos(\theta_3) + \sin(\theta_1)\sin(\theta_2)\sin(\theta_3) \)`
- `\( a_{23} = -\cos(\theta_1)\sin(\theta_3) + \sin(\theta_1)\sin(\theta_2)\cos(\theta_3) \)`
- `\( a_{31} = -\sin(\theta_2) \)`
- `\( a_{32} = \cos(\theta_2)\sin(\theta_3) \)`
- `\( a_{33} = \cos(\theta_2)\cos(\theta_3) \)`

### RTL Design Approach

#### Inputs:
- `(\sin(\theta_1), \sin(\theta_2), \sin(\theta_3)\)`
- `(\cos(\theta_1), \cos(\theta_2), \cos(\theta_3)\)`
- Valid signal to indicate that the inputs are ready for processing

#### Outputs:
- Nine matrix elements `((a_{11}, a_{12}, a_{13}, ..., a_{33}))`

#### FSM States:
1. **Idle State**: Waits for the valid bit to become high.
2. **Compute State**: Calculates the matrix elements.
3. **Done State**: Indicates that the calculation is complete and the output is valid.

#### Optimized Strategy:
1. **Combinational Logic Sharing**: We can reuse intermediate terms across the matrix elements, such as:
   - `(sin(θ 1)cos(θ 2)) for both (a{21}) and (a{12})`
   - `(cos(θ 1)sin(θ 2)) for both (a{13}) and (a{12})`
   
2. **Pipelining**: Break the computation into multiple pipeline stages. Each pipeline stage will perform part of the computation, allowing concurrent calculations for different rows or matrix elements.

3. **Parallelism**: Some matrix elements are independent of each other and can be calculated in parallel, such as \(a_{31}, a_{32}, a_{33}\), which only depend on `(θ 2) and (θ 3)`.

### RTL Design

Here’s a possible RTL implementation using Verilog:

#### Top-Level Module
```verilog
module rotation_matrix(
    input logic clk,
    input logic rst_n,
    input logic valid,
    input logic [31:0] sin1, cos1,  // Inputs: sin(θ1), cos(θ1)
    input logic [31:0] sin2, cos2,  // Inputs: sin(θ2), cos(θ2)
    input logic [31:0] sin3, cos3,  // Inputs: sin(θ3), cos(θ3)
    output logic [31:0] a11, a12, a13,
    output logic [31:0] a21, a22, a23,
    output logic [31:0] a31, a32, a33,
    output logic ready
);

    // Intermediate Signals
    logic [31:0] t1, t2, t3, t4, t5, t6;

    // FSM States
    typedef enum logic [1:0] {IDLE, COMPUTE, DONE} state_t;
    state_t state, next_state;

    // FSM Transitions
    always_ff @(posedge clk or negedge rst_n) begin
        if (!rst_n)
            state <= IDLE;
        else
            state <= next_state;
    end

    always_comb begin
        next_state = state;
        case(state)
            IDLE: if (valid) next_state = COMPUTE;
            COMPUTE: next_state = DONE;
            DONE: next_state = IDLE;
        endcase
    end

    // Computation of matrix elements
    always_ff @(posedge clk) begin
        if (state == COMPUTE) begin
            // Compute shared intermediate terms
            t1 <= sin1 * cos2;
            t2 <= cos1 * sin2;
            t3 <= cos1 * cos2;
            t4 <= sin2 * sin3;
            t5 <= sin1 * sin3;
            t6 <= cos1 * sin3;

            // Row 1
            a11 <= cos1 * cos2;
            a12 <= -sin1 * cos3 + t2 * sin3;
            a13 <= t5 + t2 * cos3;

            // Row 2
            a21 <= t1;
            a22 <= cos1 * cos3 + t1 * sin3;
            a23 <= -t6 + t1 * cos3;

            // Row 3
            a31 <= -sin2;
            a32 <= cos2 * sin3;
            a33 <= cos2 * cos3;
        end
    end

    // Output ready signal
    always_ff @(posedge clk) begin
        if (state == DONE)
            ready <= 1;
        else
            ready <= 0;
    end

endmodule
```

### Explanation:
- **State Machine**:
  - **IDLE**: Waits for the `valid` signal.
  - **COMPUTE**: Once `valid` is high, the FSM moves to the compute state, and matrix elements are computed using combinational logic.
  - **DONE**: After computation, the output is ready, and the `ready` signal is asserted.

- **Computation**:
  - Common sub-expressions like `sin1 * cos2` (used in both \(a_{21}\) and \(a_{22}\)) are calculated once and stored in intermediate variables like `t1`, `t2`, etc.
  - All elements are calculated in parallel using the pipeline stages.

### Optimization Highlights:
- **Parallelism**: The use of parallel arithmetic operations speeds up the matrix element computation.
- **Pipelining**: Although not explicitly shown, pipelining could be added to split the matrix computation across clock cycles for high throughput.
- **FSM Control**: The state machine ensures the calculation happens only when the valid signal is high, and the output is marked ready when the computation is done.

This RTL design can be further optimized for specific hardware platforms, such as using DSP slices or hardware multipliers, based on the FPGA or ASIC design constraints.
