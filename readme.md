## **Project Overview**

This project implements various matrix operations using Verilog, specifically focusing on 3x3 matrices. It provides modules for matrix multiplication, matrix inversion (for upper triangular matrices), and rotation matrix generation using trigonometric functions. The core of the mathematical operations relies on a `CORDIC` (COordinate Rotation DIgital Computer) module, which performs efficient fixed-point arithmetic calculations for division, sine, and cosine values. 

### **MATLAB Models**
To verify and validate the Verilog implementation, MATLAB models were developed for both floating-point and fixed-point calculations. The models simulate the matrix operations and ensure that the results match the hardware outputs in accuracy and behavior.

The key modules in this project include:

- `cordic`: Implements CORDIC-based division and trigonometric calculations.
- `matrix_multiply`: Performs matrix multiplication between two 3x3 matrices.
- `inv_3x3_upper_triangular`: Computes the inverse of an upper triangular 3x3 matrix.
- `rotation_matrix1`, `rotation_matrix2`, `rotation_matrix3`: Generate rotation matrices using trigonometric inputs.
- `matrix_operations_top`: A top-level module integrating all the above components.

### **Problem Definition**

**Problem Definition**:Inverting a 3x3 matrix is a fundamental operation in many systems, such as signal processing, control systems, and wireless communications. In digital IC design, matrix inversion must be implemented efficiently to meet the high-performance and Time requirements.

**Challenges**:
In hardware, matrix inversion is computationally intensive.

Direct methods (e.g., Gaussian elimination) involve complex divisions, multiplications, and addition operations, making them costly in terms of area, power, and timing in digital circuits.

### **Challenges of Traditional Methods in Hardware**

**Resource Intensive:**
The number of operations grows quadratically with the size of the matrix **(O(n¬≥))**.

- This consumes more hardware resources (adders, multipliers, dividers), leading to large chip area and higher power consumption.

**Latency:**
- Complex arithmetic operations cause longer delays, impacting real-time system performance.

- Traditional methods can introduce significant delays in processing.

- Division operations in particular are Hard to implement in hardware. (To save area or time)

### **Why QR Decomposition with CORDIC?**

**CORDIC:**
- It avoids the need for multipliers and dividers, using only shifts and adds, which are more hardware-efficient.
- Fixed-point arithmetic allows for a reduction in hardware complexity compared to floating-point implementations.

**QR Decomposition:**
- Breaks the matrix inversion problem into simpler steps involving rotations.
- Givens rotations (used in QR) can be easily implemented using CORDIC, allowing for efficient triangularization of the matrix.
- Once the matrix is triangular, the inverse is easier to calculate using back-substitution.

### **Hardware Benefits of CORDIC-based QR Decomposition**

**Reduced Complexity:**
- No division operations required, making it suitable for hardware implementation.
- CORDIC operations use shift-add algorithms, minimizing the use of multipliers.
**Pipelining and Parallelism:**
- The design can be pipelined to achieve high throughput.
- Iterative CORDIC processing allows for parallel execution, optimizing speed.
**Area and Power Efficiency:**
- CORDIC is known for being low-power and area-efficient, crucial for digital IC design.
- Ideal for embedded systems where power and area are limited resources.

### **Floating-Point Model Using MATLAB**

- The MATLAB code implements a floating-point model for performing 3x3 matrix inversion using QR decomposition combined with CORDIC operations. 


**Inputs**

**Outputs**

![Alt Block](images/Picture2.png)


### **Fixed-Point Representation**

- Inputs are converted into fixed-point format using a specified word length (e.g., 16-bit) and fraction length (e.g., 12-bit) for high precision.
- **Resource Efficiency:** Lower hardware resource consumption compared to floating-point arithmetic, making it suitable for embedded systems.
- **Deterministic Precision:** Fixed-point arithmetic guarantees predictable behavior and precision.
- **Scalability:** The CORDIC algorithm is iterative and scalable for various precision levels. 


All matrices and intermediate calculations are performed using fixed-point arithmetic, defined by the following parameters:

- `WORDLEN = 16`: Total bit-width of the fixed-point representation.
- `FRACTION_WIDTH = 12`: Number of fractional bits.

The default scaling factor for inputs is `2^12` (i.e., 12 fractional bits). Outputs are scaled down accordingly to fit the defined format.

## **Modules and Functionality**

### 1. **CORDIC Algorithm Implementation (`cordic`)**

### **What is cordic**
- **CORDIC (COordinate Rotation DIgital Computer)** is a hardware-efficient iterative algorithm used in this project to perform various trigonometric, hyperbolic, and vector operations. For the 3x3 matrix inversion using QR decomposition, we applied CORDIC to compute rotations and vector operations needed to perform the **QR decomposition** in fixed-point precision. This allowed for efficient calculation of the Q and R matrices with reduced hardware complexity

### **CORDIC General Functionality**
- **CORDIC** is an algorithm designed to calculate a wide range of mathematical functions using only additions, subtractions, bit shifts, and look-up tables. It is especially useful for systems where multiplication and division operations are costly.

**Cordic Blocks**

- Rotational 
- Vectoring 
- Division

### **CORDIC Vectoring for Zeroing Elements**

**Vectoring Mode:** The algorithm rotates the vector towards the x-axis by adjusting x and y coordinates.
**Iterations:** 15 steps using shift-add operations with LUT for angle adjustments.

**Result:**
- Provides final magnitude and theta angle after N iterations.
- Fixed-point scaling using a precomputed constant (K).

**Optimization**
- Theta is Normalized by 2ùúã , for higher accuracy.

### **CORDIC Rotation for Matrix Updates**

**Purpose**: Rotates input vector (x_in, y_in) by a given angle (Œ∏_in).
**Key Operations**: Iteratively rotates vector to achieve desired angle, outputting rotated coordinates (x_out, y_out).
**Precision**: 16-bit fixed-point arithmetic.
**Core Features**:

![Alt Block](images/Picture12.png)

### **CORDIC Division Algorithm**


**Initialization:**
- Numerator (y) and Denominator (x) are set.
- Sign of numerator is tracked separately to apply at the end.
**Iterative Process (CORDIC-like method)**:
- Perform N iterations to converge on the quotient.
- If y (denominator) is negative, adjust y and decrement the quotient.
- If y is positive, adjust y and increment the quotient.
- **Step size** scales with the iteration to converge faster.
**Final State:**
After N iterations, apply the sign to the result and set done.
**Key Features:**
- **Word Length**: WORD_LENGTH = 16, allowing for signed 16-bit inputs.
- **Precision**: Uses 12 fractional bits.
- **Error Handling**: Detects zero numerator to prevent undefined division.

### **Enhancements to CORDIC Division Algorithm**

**Problem Addressed:**
- **Negative Division:** Initially, the algorithm didn't handle negative denominators.

**Solution Implemented:**
- **Handling Negative Numbers:**
Added support for division by negative numbers by extending the sign handling for both numerator and denominator. Now, the algorithm ensures correct results with both positive and negative inputs.

**Error Signal** out if the Matrix has No inverse and stop the Operations

**Problem Addressed:**
- **Output Limitation:** The quotient was capped at a maximum of 2 due to the algorithm's structure, leading to incorrect results in certain cases.

**Solution Implemented:**
- Adjusted the algorithm to ensure proper scaling of the result by bit-shifting the numerator.
- This correction removes the limitation, allowing the quotient to reach beyond 2, ensuring accurate results for a wider range of input values.
